    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a master's student in Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, specializing in AI/ML and software development.
        As an AI Research Assistant, collaborate with professors and AI researchers on groundbreaking projects in AI for healthcare. My work revolves around leveraging 3D human modeling, large language models (LLMs), and advanced AI techniques to create innovative solutions. Weight and Height Estimation in Hospital Emergency Condition - Using AI and 3D modeling, I've developed solutions for accurately estimating body metrics with a single 3D camera.
        Gait Analysis and Fall Detection - Working on an AI-driven project to analyze human gait and detect falls, aiming to assist in emergency scenarios.
        I'm leading the development of backend systems, Python programming, machine learning models, and web-based applications to bring these solutions to life.
        Published 3 research papers in this domain, contributing to advancements in AI-powered healthcare. Itâ€™s making a difference in critical areas like patient safety and emergency care.
        
        I had the opportunity to work with the South Florida Water Management District as a Research Assistant, where I developed a machine learning tool tailored to their needs. This tool was instrumental in identifying outliers and detecting anomalies in hydrological data, contributing to improved water management.
        
        Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at KPIT, developing and testing software components using Java, C/C++, Python, and Angular. I contributed to a plugin registry project for vehicle networks, focusing on voice recognition, image processing, and system libraries, earning the "STAR OF THE SPRINT" award. Additionally, I gained experience in robotic development using Docker, SSH, RViz, and Python on Linux platforms
        
        Besides my technical skills, I am also passionate about theatre, and cultural and social activities. I received an award for "The best student in cultural events" in my bachelor's degree, and I conducted a theatre workshop for "underprivileged students" at the Bhumi Foundation in Pune, India. I presented two academic projects using Java, SVM, and MySQL at the International Conference on Innovative Practices in Engineering Technology, and received an outstanding grade for them.
        
        I am eager to learn new skills, explore new challenges, and collaborate with diverse and talented teams.</p>
